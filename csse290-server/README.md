# Server Code.
This directory contains project server code and client web pages for the CSSE 290 class. 

Note: The server process needs to be running. 

I use nohup to do that. the following command keeps the server process running:

nohup python mainserver.py &


To kill the server, kill the python process by typing:

pkill -9 python
